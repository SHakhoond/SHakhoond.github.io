       <h3> 
         What is the relationship between  mindfulness and self awareness?
       </h3>
       <p>
        They are similar concepts. Self awareness is being aware of one's state 
        even when surrounded by a a mix of emotions. Mindfulness is keeping 
        the focus/attention at the present moment accepting all the thoughts 
        that could cause distraction. Attaining mindfulness can help develop 
        self awareness.
       </p>
       <h3>Try atleast one of the self awareness practices from the chapter( 
       body scan, journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you 
       feel?</h3>
       <p>
        I tried the body scan exercise. It made my entire body very relaxed and 
        I almost felt as if I was going to fall asleep. Scanning through the 
        different parts of the body I could sense stress in some of them but 
        focusing on them individually relaxed them. When thinking about a happy 
        event, I noticed movement in my eyes and lips as I was smiling and also 
        the breathing changed a bit. Overall after the exercise, my body and 
        mind were in a much more relaxed state and emotionally I was feeling 
        more at peace and happier.
       </p>
       <h3>What did you take away from the “My emotions are not me” section?</h3>   
       <p>
         I understood that my emotions are only temporary experience of how I 
         feel at a particular moment and they do not define who I really am. 
         And this means I can shift from one emotion to another if I want to. 
         The sky and clouds analogy was a great help in understanding this.
