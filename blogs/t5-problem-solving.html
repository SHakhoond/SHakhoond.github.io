           Problem Solving
       </h1>
       <h2> 
         1. Got blocked on a simple problem.
       </h2>
       <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
       <p>
         I got stuck on racer game, I didn't know from where I should start 
         coding, actually I haven't any idea for that.
       </p>
       <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
       <p>
         I used Psuedocode and write my structure on paper and try to break my 
         race game parts down. Then I wrote my codes sectiion by section. 
       </p>
       <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
       <p>
         At the first I was confused so ,what shoul I do now, but as soon as I 
         start to write first line everything going to be clear and easy to 
         manage. 
       </p>
       <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
       <p>
         I learn not having a plan or structure for writting your code it's 
         easier to get confuse and last.  
       </p>

       <h2>
         2. Solved a problem in an elegant way.
       </h2>
       <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
       <p>
         In my race game I didn't know how I can implement TDs anytime the 
         player choice the length of the game and also I wanted to restart the 
         game when I have a winner. 
       </p>
       <h3> What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
       <p>
         I googling and check using console.log 
       </p>
       <h3> How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
       <p>
         That was good feeling, after spending a lot time finally find the rigth 
         code
       </p>
       <h3> What did you learn?</h3>
       <p>
         I learnt how to make a plan and structure
       </p>
       <p><strong> Psuedocode</strong> I'm confident to use this technique and 
       help me to break the problem down</p>
       <p><strong> Trying something</strong> </p>
       <p><strong> Rubber ducky method</strong>I haven't tried it </p>
       <p><strong> Reading error messages</strong>it was the best thing I did, 
       everytime I had an error I read the error carefully </p>
       <p><strong> Console.logging</strong>I'm confident with console.log I 
       used the console.log a lot. it helps me to find the section I'm working 
       on it works right.  </p>
       <p><strong> Googling</strong>Ofcoure googling is important, I always 
       search on google we I can't figure a problem with myself</p>
       <p><strong> Asking your peers for help</strong>I haven't tried it </p>
       <p><strong> Asking coaches for help</strong>I haven't tried it </p>
       <p><strong> Improving your process with reflection</strong> </p>
       <h3>Explain to your non-tech friend</h3>
       <p><strong> .map()</strong>The map method takes a group of element of 
       an Array and performs a set of conditions (function) to each item in 
       the array in the order that they appear, then takes the results that 
       that process generates to form a new array. </p>
       <p><strong> .filter()</strong> Similar to the map method, the filter 
       method takes a group of items (an array) and performs a set of 
       conditions (function) to each item in the array in the order that they 
       appear, but then takes only the results that pass/agree with the set of 
       conditions that process generates to form a new array. </p>
       <p><strong> .reduce()</strong> </p>
