           Daily Mindfulnees
       </h1>
       <h3> 
         What did you learn from your minfulness conversation?
       </h3>
       <p>
         I performed this exercise with my beloved wife. She usually has my 
         full attention when we talk but this experience felt different. 
         Knowing that she was listening and focusing sincerely to every word 
         that I spoke, I was able to express myself much clearly. Not getting 
         interrupted in the middle also helped me keep the flow. When it was 
         her turn to talk, I found that as I listened to her there were 
         thoughts arising inside of my head but when I tried to bring back the 
         focus to her voice they slowly disappeared. So the most important 
         learning for me was, It is ok for thoughts to arise inside my head. I 
         need not try to force them away. Instead slowly shift my focus to the 
         thing that needs attention.
       </p>
       <h3>How did the other person find it?</h3>
       <p>
         My wife loved the exercise “apart from the point where I was the one 
         who was getting to do all the talking” (YOU CAN DELETE THE WORDS IN 
         QUOTES SHAYAN ;) ). She really appreciated my efforts when I tried to 
         explain to her what I thought she talked about, so that I could 
         understand her correctly.
       </p>
       <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your 
       practice?</h>   
       <p>
         I think I will start with an easy technique i.e. One mindful breath a 
         day and slowly start increasing the number of mindful breaths per day 
         and then occasionally try the other techniques.
