       <h3>
          Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing 
          trust and sincerity? How did it go?
       </h3>
       <p>
         Yes, upon trying to gain trust and sincerity during a converstion, I 
         felt that the other person was able to open up more than she usually 
         does. Not just that but I was more receptive to his views and ideas 
         too.
       </p>
       <h3>
          Try empathic listening - how did it go?
       </h3>
       <p>
         While performing this listening execise, I kept trying to put myself 
         in the listener's shoes and also kept reminding myself that this 
         person is just like me. That helped me really understand how she must 
         be feeling as she spoke the words. Although some of her ideas didn't 
         match my own views, yet I was happy to hear them and later discuss 
         them.

          At the end of the process, the speaker seemed touched by how well I 
          was able to understand not just her words but also how she felt. She 
          also liked that even though I disagreed on some of her views I didn't 
          interrupt her right away and tried to understand things from her 
          perspective.

       <h3> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
       <p>
         Just like other meditations it had calming effect on me but in addition 
         it also made me happy. Thinking of happiness of a closed one throughout 
         the meditation filled me up with immense love, joy and kindness.
